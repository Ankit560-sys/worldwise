## 🔧 Backend 

This project uses **JSON Server** as a mock backend to simulate a REST API.

- The backend runs **locally** using JSON Server.
- It is used to manage city and country data (CRUD operations).
- The frontend is fully functional and deployed.
- To use full functionality (add, edit, delete cities), the JSON Server must be running locally.

This approach was chosen to focus on **frontend architecture, routing, state management, and API integration**.  
The mock backend can be replaced with a real backend in a production environment.
